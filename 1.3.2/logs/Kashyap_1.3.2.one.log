#11. Running multiple lines at once makes it easier to run programs that have lots of lines of code. Conditionals and loops are easier to use as well since Python is whitespace sensitive
#12. The functions and stuff that had to passed in Scratch were placed within the conditionals, loops, or functions
#13. You want to make sure that people who are using your functions know exactly what the function is used for and what parameters are neccesary to input
#14. It saves memory and it allows the computer to process large programs without making the computer crash because of the lack of memory management
#15. It is when you translate everything at once for one person to understand and to do the same again with the other person after the first person is done

#Conclusion 1. Basic formulas and functions that are necessary when trying to implement graphics or Machine Learning Frameworks
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:14:53
#Conclusion 2. Integer, Float
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:15:39
#Conclusion 2 continued. are the native data types that we learnt about
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:17:34
#Conclusion 3. You can keep track of every single line of code prior t running the program in the code editor while you have to run each line by itself in the ipython enviornment
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:18:45
#Conclusion 4. You will only need to call the function instead of writing each line of code over and over again
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:19:42
#Conclusion 5. %run 1.3.2/Kashyap_1.3.2.py
# Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:23:20
#Conclusion 5 continued. To show that without printing to the console, the user won't be able to know what a certain function outputs. Print statements allow the user to check if their functions are working properly
